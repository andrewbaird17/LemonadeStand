Lemonade Stand Simulation Game

Austin - Open/Closed Principle - During the coding project when we were still in the planning phase. I thought that we could adhear to the Open/Closed principle by
making the list of weather into a parent "weather" class, and making the "weather conditions" into children classes. This gives the option to expand by easily adding
more children under the weather class, and into the randomizer to expand how dynamic the game is. It also means that the gameplay coding isnt changed when adding those
conditions.
